    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "\n",
    "A Gradient boosting classifier is an example of an ensemble learning method which enhances the performance of a machine learning model by combining many weak learning models together to create a strong predictive model.A weak learning model refers to a simple model that does a little bit better than a random chance. A random chance can be any set threshold or value. A decision tree (weak learner) is usually used when doing gradient boosting. Gradient boosting classifiers are specific types of algorithms used for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind gradient boosting is that it takes a weak hypothesis or weak learning algorithm and makes a series of changes to it that will improve the strength of the hypothesis/learner. This type of hypothesis boosting is based on the idea of Probability Approximately Correct Learning (PAC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how does PAC work? This learning method nvestigates machine learning problems to interpret how complex they are, and a similar method is applied to Hypothesis Boosting. In hypothesis boosting, you notice all the observations in which the machine learning algorithm is trained on, and you only keep the observation whose machine learning method were successfully, taking out the other observations. A new weak learner is created and tested on the set of data that was poorly classified, and just the examples that were successfully classified are kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of Gradient Boosting classifiers is to minimize the loss, or the difference between the actual class value of the training example and the predicted class value. It operates similarly to gradient descent in a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How Gradient Boosting works\n",
    "Gradient Boosting involves three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Loss Function: Depending on the problem being solved, the loss function differs. It must be differentiable. A regression problem uses a mean squared error while a classification problem uses a logarithmic loss. Note that in gradient boosting, the loss function needs to be optimized(improved).\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Weak Learner: A gradient boosting classifier needs a a weak learner so as to make predictions and form strong learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "c)  Additive Model: The additive model is used to regularize(minimize) the loss function by adding more weak learners to the model. This comes from the fact that trees are added to the odel over time, and when this occurs the existing trees aren’t manipulated, their values remain fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize error between given parameters in gradient descent, this is done by performing gradient descent on the calculated loss between the given parameters, so as to reduce the loss. After that the tree parameters are adjusted(or modified) to reduce the residual loss. The new output of the tree is then appended to the output of the previous trees used in the model. This process is repeated until a previously specified number of trees is reached, or the loss is reduced below a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to Gradient Boosting:\n",
    "To implement a gradient boosting classifier, a number of different steps have to be carried out. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fit the model\n",
    "2. Tune the model's parameters and Hyperparameters\n",
    "3. Make predictions\n",
    "4. Interpret the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "When tuning the model's hyperparameters, it requires some active decision making on our part. There are various arguments/hyperparameters we can tune to try and get the best accuracy for the model. One of the ways we can do this is by altering the learning rate of the model. We will want to check the performance of the model on the training set at different learning rates, and then use the best learning rate to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When making predictions, we predict on the features of the testing dataset, and then compare the predictions to the actual labels. The process of evaluating a classifier typically involves checking the accuracy of the classifier and then adjusting the parameters/hyperparameters of the model until the classifier has an accuracy that the user is satisfied with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Improvements to Basic Gradient Boosting:\n",
    "Gradient boosting is considered to be a greedy algorithm because it takes the best path in a decision tree. It can quickly overfit a training dataset due to this. Overfitting occurs when our model trains very well but generalizes poorly to the dataset. You can liken overfitting to an exam situation. You memorize your notes so well but you fail to use what you learnt from your notes to answer your exam questions. So you perform poorly in your exams. That is a realistic example of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to my explanation on gradient boosting, to reduce overfitting and improve the performance of the algorithm, different constraints or regularization methods can be used. They include ; \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Penalized Learning: The structure of the decision tree determines what constraints are put in place to prevent overfitting. The type of decision tree used in gradient boosting is a regression tree, which has numeric values as leaves or weights. We can regularize these weight values using various regularization methods such as L1(L1 norm or Lasso) or L2(or Ridge) regularization weights which penalizes the boosting algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tree Constraints: The more constraints used when creating trees, the more trees the model will need to properly fit the data. The decision tree can be constrained in numerous ways such as limiting the tree depth, imposing a limit on the number of leaves or nodes of the tree, limiting the number of observations per split, and limiting the number of observations trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Shrinkage/Weighted Updates: Due to the predictions of each tree being summed together, the contributions of the trees can be inhibited or slowed down using a technique called shrinkage. A \"learning rate\" is adjusted, and when the learning rate is reduced more trees must be added to the model. This makes it so that the model needs longer to train. There's a trade-off between the learning rate and the number of trees needed, so we have to experiment to find the best values for each of the parameters, but small values less than 0.1 or values between 0.1 and 0.3 often work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Random sampling: A technique known as stochastic gradient boosting can also help prevent overfitting, when taking random subsamples of the training data set. This technique essentially reduces the strength of the correlation between trees. There are various ways to subsample the data set, such as subsampling columns before each split, subsampling columns before creating a tree, and subsampling rows before creating a tree. In general, subsampling at large rates not exceeding 50% of the data seems to be beneficial to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. XGBoost: This means \"eXtreme Gradient Boosting\", and it refers to the fact that the algorithms and methods have been customized to push the limit of what is possible for gradient boosting algorithms. XGBoost is a refined and customized version of a gradient boosting decision tree system, created with performance and speed in mind.\n",
