## Finding-Donors-for-CharityML

In this project, I applied my knowledge of supervised learning techniques to identify the top potential donors for a charity organization company, CharityML. This minimizes the donation letters to be sent to potential donors.

The dataset contains approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This includes; age, workclass, education_level, education-num, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week, and native-country. The goal is to determine income earners earning $50,000 or more anually. Hence the target in this case is the income.

Note that the visual.py python file as well as the census.csv dataset file will be required to complete this work. 

At the end of the project, I was able to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.
