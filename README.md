# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML

### Project Description:
CharityML, a fictitious charity organization that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning.They determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to only those most likely to donate to the charity. The goal is to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.
